            <h1>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...</h1>
            <p>
            A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title. 
            War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls 
            into infinity.

                It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

                During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                power to destroy an entire planet.

                Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                restore freedom to the galaxy...

            The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
            eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
            silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers 
            from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed 
            by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
            laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing 
            the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

            <h2>INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY</h2>
            <p>
        An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
        D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way 
        through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are 
        old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
        face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
        Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of 
        human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic 
        surface of an Art Deco design.

        Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

            <h4>THREEPIO</h4>
            <p>
                Did you hear that? They've shut down 
                the main reactor. We'll be destroyed 
                for sure. This is madness!

                Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in 
                the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.
            </p>
            <h4>THREEPIO</h4>
            <p>
                We're doomed!

                The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that 
                only another robot could understand.
            </p>
            <h4>THREEPIO</h4>
            <p>
                There'll be no escape for the Princess 
                this time.

                Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as 
                loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment 
                are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.
